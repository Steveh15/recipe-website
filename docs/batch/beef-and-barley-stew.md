# Beef and Barley Stew


## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2–3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 carrots, sliced into thick coins
- 3 celery stalks, sliced
- 1 cup pearl barley
- 6 cups beef broth (low sodium preferred)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- Optional: 1/2 cup red wine (replace equal broth if not using)

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
- Sear the beef: Pat beef dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1–2 tbsp olive oil in the Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches, without crowding the pan. Set aside.
- Sauté veggies:
Lower the heat slightly. Add a bit more oil if needed, then sauté onion, carrots, and celery until softened (about 5–7 minutes). Stir in garlic and tomato paste, cook for 1–2 more minutes.
- Deglaze (if using wine):
Add wine and scrape up brown bits from the bottom. Let it simmer for a minute.
- Combine everything:
Return beef to the pot. Add barley, broth, Worcestershire, herbs, bay leaves, and a pinch more salt and pepper. Stir well.
- Cook low and slow: Cover with the Dutch oven lid and place in the oven for 3.5 to 4 hours, stirring once halfway through if you like. The beef should be meltingly tender and the barley plump.
- Final touch: Remove bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning. If the stew is too thick, stir in a bit of hot water or broth. If too thin, let it sit uncovered on the stovetop to reduce slightly.
