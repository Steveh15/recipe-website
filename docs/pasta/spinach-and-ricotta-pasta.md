## Instructions

1. **IF USING FRESH SPINACH** Pull the leaves from the stems and discard the latter. Soak, rinse and cook the spinach and gently squeeze the moisture from it. Finely chop it and set aside.
2. **IF USING THAWED FROZEN SPINACH** With your hands, squeeze the moisture from it, finely chop it and set aside.
3. Put half the butter in a sauté pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the butter foam begins to subside, add the ham, stir quickly once or twice, then add the spinach and a liberal pinch of salt. Bear in mind that apart from the ricotta, which has no salt, the spinach is the principal component of the sauce and must be adequately seasoned. Sauté the spinach over a lively heat, turning it frequently, for about 2 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat, mix in the grated nutmeg.
5. Cook pasta. Toss with the spinach and the remaining butter and grated parmesan
